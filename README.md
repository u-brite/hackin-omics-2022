## Background

Following the success of our previous UBRITE data science hackathons (2019, 2020, and 2021) organized by the [UAB Informatics Institute](https://www.uab.edu/medicine/informatics/), we are planning to run Hackin’ Omics virtually from August 5th to 6th in collaboration with the [Center for Computational Genomics and Data Science (CGDS)](https://sites.uab.edu/cgds/). We hope to encourage more UAB and non-UAB participants to take advantage of this opportunity to have fun by networking with peers in the scientific community and by participating on multidisciplinary teams to learn new skills and achieve goals for novel project proposals.

## Theme

The theme for Hackin’ Omics is: multi-omics downstream analysis for discovery of novel translational findings and development of new tools using existing public datasets. 

## Goals

- Broaden the collaborative community at UAB and abroad by building teams of domain experts, scientists/researchers, and developers.
- Enable teams to achieve outcomes such as scripted pipelines, tutorials, tools, and novel omics analyses.
- Allow researchers to advance existing multi-omics projects and analyze their own datasets.
- Strengthen the professional development of participants by providing opportunities for training and networking.

## Getting Started

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one and update your registration information at https://airtable.com/shr3eEleXAe0ppYes.
2. Log into slack using the link that was emailed to you. Introduce yourself in the `#general` channel and find your team's channel.
3. Get to know your teammates and others by interacting in the `#music`, `#random`, and `#pet-photos` channels.
